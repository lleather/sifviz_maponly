#TO do:

##Design:
- choose color scheme
    range([#FEEB97, #4FB783, #409D9B, #034561]
    [#FFF1BC, #7DC383, #6A9C78, #446E5C]
    #EEEEEE#4ECCA3#393E46#23293

- choose font family
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Montserrat|Roboto|Rubik|Open+Sans" rel="stylesheet">

    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
    font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif;

    font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;

- choose favicon
<link rel="icon" href="img/greendiamond.ico" type="image/x-icon"/>


- raster processing: make NAs 0 when they overlap with land; retain NAs as -999 when they're over water

- what is the purpose of the map?
    - show spatial and temporal variation in plant growth
        - seasonally
        - in response to drought
            - potential zoom in to US for 2012 drought?
        - vector u and v: average of other july months - july 2012

- web slides for interactive digital storytelling - alpenglow applications? and/or sharing our gender 101 content, etc?
    - buncha code babies

    data are what brings it all together

- brian's github project - lab for vector field demo. wil include read me

+ DC slider for time series attached to points
    - best way to organize these data?
    - edit and upload R code used for data processing


- marilynne robinson, the givenness of things. see: john west.
- also thinking about: that BLUE game / narrative, made by another obie?
